# pp-research-tools

Python notebooks and tools for data science tasks with a faculty research group.

## Description

This repo documents my data science work for the Project Exercise class, where I collaborate with a faculty research group on various data analysis and machine learning tasks. I utilize some parts of their [original codebase (dr-playground)](https://github.com/OviOvocny/dr-playground), which is NOT included.

## Usage

1. To use the python notebooks and tools in this repo, you need to copy them into the [dr-playground](https://github.com/OviOvocny/dr-playground) alongside the `requirements_extended.txt` file

2. Don't forget to install the additional packages used in some of the notebooks by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_extended.txt
   ```
3. Run `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` as usual
